# JWST/MIRI Fomalhaut images

Archive of our recently published JWST/MIRI images of the Fomalhaut Debris Disk system (nature link). We provide the final reduced FITS images (both with and without distortion correction) as well as figures and presentation quality images.

## Labeled 25.5 micron image

This image highlights the various components identified in the 25.5 micron MIRI image

## Deprojected images

Here, we show how the system would appear as if viewed face-on utilizing orbit fitting to determine the inclination and position angle of the system.

## FITS images

FITS images are provided at 15.5, 23.0, and 25.5 micron. The images are in MJy/sr flux units and absolute flux calibrated following the methods described in our paper. For the 23 and 25.5 micron observatoins, we also provide distortion corrected solutions.
